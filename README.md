# React Sliders Showcase

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of two distinct slider implementations within React:

1. A custom-coded slider, developed from scratch to provide a hands-on understanding of React components.
2. A slider developed using the renowned `slick` library, accentuated with enhanced features like auto-slide and a hover-to-pause functionality.

Both sliders serve as illustrative examples of data iteration techniques and the versatility of React components.

## Features

- **Custom-Coded Slider**: My personal take on slider functionality, complete with an auto-slide feature to transition between images seamlessly.
- **Slick Slider**: Leveraging the capabilities of the slick library, this slider brings in smooth transitions with the added convenience of auto-slide play. The slide progression intuitively halts when the user hovers over it, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
